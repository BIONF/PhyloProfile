# Introduction
Phylogenetic profiles capture the presence - absence pattern of genes across
species (Pellegrini et al., 1999). The presence of an ortholog in a given
species is often taken as evidence that also the corresponding function is
represented (Lee et al., 2007). Moreover, if two genes agree in their
phylogenetic profile, it can suggest that they functionally interact
(Pellegrini et al., 1999). Phylogenetic profiles are therefore commonly used
for tracing functional protein clusters or metabolic networks across species
and through time. However, orthology inference is not error-free (Altenhoff
et al., 2016), and orthology does not guarantee functional equivalence for
two genes (Studer and Robinson-Rechavi, 2009). Therefore, phylogenetic
profiles are often integrated with accessory information layers, such as
sequence similarity, domain architecture similarity, or semantic similarity
of Gene Ontology-term descriptions.

Various approaches exist to visualize such profiles. However, there is still a
shortage of tools that provide a comprehensive set of functions for the display,
filtering and analysis of multi-layered phylogenetic profiles comprising
hundreds of genes and taxa. To close this methodological gap, we present here
**PhyloProfile**, an *R-based tool to visualize, explore and analyze
multi-layered phylogenetic profiles*.

# How to install PhyloProfile

To install the PhyloProfile package via [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org)
using BiocManager:

```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager"))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("PhyloProfile")
```

To install the dev version from [github](https://github.com/BIONF/PhyloProfile):

```r
if (!requireNamespace("devtools"))
    install.packages("devtools", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
devtools::install_github(
    "bionf/phyloprofile",
    INSTALL_opts = c('--no-lock'),
    build_opts = c('--no-resave-data')
)
```

Or use directly the online version at
http://applbio.biologie.uni-frankfurt.de/phyloprofile/.

# Input
PhyloProfile expects as a main input the phylogenetic distribution of orthologs,
or more generally of homologs. This information can be complemented with domain
architecture annotation and data for up to two additional annotation layers.

Beside tab delimited text and sequences in FASTA format, the tool also accepts
orthoXML (Schmitt et al., 2011), or a list of OMA IDs (Altenhoff et al., 2015)
as input.

Here is an example of a tab delimited input with two additional annotation
layers:
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
data("main_long_raw", package="phyloprofile")
knitr::kable(head(main_long_raw, 10))
```

*The [WIKI](https://github.com/BIONF/PhyloProfile/wiki/Input-Data) accompanying
PhyloProfile gives a comprehensive guide of how to format input data.*

# Features and capabilities
## Interactive visualization and dynamic exploration of phylogenetic profiles
Together with several functions for exploring phylogenetic profiles, we provide
an interactive visualization application implemented with
[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shiny).

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="PhyloProfile's GUI", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("poster.png")
```

For both command-based and visualization analyses, users can:

- dynamically **change the resolution of the analysis** from invidual species
to phyla or entire kingdoms by collapsing the input taxa into higher systematic
rank. Species are automatically linked to the NCBI taxonomy, and are ordered
in increasing taxonomic distance from a user-specified reference taxon.
*PhyloProfile is able to represent co-orthologs (in-paralogs), if the working
taxonomic rank is the deepest one (e.g. strain or species) that can be
found in the input taxa.*
- dynamically **filter data** by applying different thresholds to the integrated
information (e.g. increasing the fraction of species in a systematic group that
must harbor an ortholog before the gene is considered present in this group
reduces the impact of spurious ortholog identification on evolutionary
interpretations).
- dynamically **modify the apperance of profile** with diverse plot
configuration options.

PhyloProfile is able to represent the entire data matrix (`Main profile`) or to
visualize only a subset of genes and taxa for a detailed inspection
(`Customized profile`), without the need of modifying the input data.

Besides, PhyloProfile's interface will be automatically varied according to
user's input files, such as the names of two additional information layers or
list of input taxa.

## Analysis functions
PhyloProfile provides several functions for dynamically analyzing phylogenetic
profiles.

### Profile clustering
The identification of proteins with similar phylogenetic profiles is a crucial
step in the identification and characterization of novel functional protein
interaction networks (Pellegrini, 2012). PhyloProfile offers the option to
cluster genes according to the distance of their phylogenetic profiles.

```{r, fig.show='hold', dev='CairoPDF'}
### An example for plotting the clustered profiles tree.
### See ?phyloprofile::get_dendrogram for more details.

#' Load built-in data
data("full_processed_profile_large", package="phyloprofile")
data <- full_processed_profile_large

#' Calculate distance matrix
#' Check ?phyloprofile::get_distance_matrix
profile_type <- "binary"
profiles <- get_data_clustering(
    data, profile_type, var1_aggregate_by, var2_aggregate_by)
method <- "mutual_information"
distance_matrix <- get_distance_matrix(profiles, method)

#' Create clustered profile tree
cluster_method <- "complete"
dd <- cluster_data_dend(distance_matrix, cluster_method)
get_dendrogram(dd)
```

### Gene age estimation
PhyloProfile can estimate the evolutionary age of a gene from the phylogenetic
profiles using an LCA algorithm (Capra et al., 2013). Specifically, the last
common ancestor of the two most distantly related species displaying a given
gene serves as the minimal gene age. Age estimates are dynamically updated
upon filtering of the data.

```{r}
### An example for calculating gene age for the built-in data set.
### See ?phyloprofile::estimate_gene_age for more details.

#' Load built-in data
data("full_processed_profile", package="phyloprofile")

#' Choose the working rank and the reference taxon
rank_name <- "class"
ref_taxon <- "Mammalia"

#' Set cutoff for 2 additional variables and the percentage of present species
#' in each supertaxon
var1_cutoff <- c(0,1)
var2_cutoff <- c(0,1)
percent_cutoff <- c(0,1)

#' Estimate gene age
estimate_gene_age(
    full_processed_profile, rank_name, ref_taxon,
    var1_cutoff, var2_cutoff, percent_cutoff
)
```

### Core gene identification
Phylogenomic reconstructions are typically based on a collection of core genes
(Daubin et al., 2002), i.e. genes that are shared among all genomes in a taxon
collection. PhyloProfile enables users to select a set of taxa and returns
their core genes.

```{r}
### An example for calculating core gene set for the built-in data set.
### See ?phyloprofile::get_core_gene for more details.

#' Load built-in data
data("full_processed_profile", package="phyloprofile")
processed_profile_data <- full_processed_profile

#' Choose the working rank and a set of taxa of interest
rank_name <- "class"
taxa_core <- c("Mammalia", "Mucorales", "Alphaproteobacteria")

#' Set cutoff for 2 additional variables and the percentage of present species
#' in each supertaxon
var1_cutoff <- c(0.75, 1.0)
var2_cutoff <- c(0.75, 1.0)
percent_cutoff <- c(0.0, 1.0)

#' Set core coverage, the % of taxa that must be present in the selected set
core_coverage <- 1

#' Identify core genes
get_core_gene(
    rank_name,
    taxa_core,
    processed_profile_data,
    var1_cutoff, var2_cutoff,
    percent_cutoff, core_coverage
)
```

### Group comparison
This function is used to compare the distribution of the additional variables
between two taxon groups, an in- and an out-group. Users can define the in-group
and all taxa not included in this are used as the out-group. The value
distributions of the variables are then compared using statistical tests
(Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney) using the specified significant
level (*0.05 by default*). Genes that have a significantly different
distribution will be shown in the candidate gene list for further analysis.

```{r}
?phyloprofile::get_significant_genes
```

### Distribution analysis
The interpretation of phylogenetic profiles, and the result of downstream
analyses can change substantially upon filtering the data. To help users to
decide on reasonable filtering thresholds, PhyloProfile provides a function to
plot the distributions of the values incurred by the integrated information
layers.

```{r, fig.show='hold', dev='CairoPDF'}
### An example for plotting the distribution of the 1st additional variable.
### See ?phyloprofile::create_var_dist_plot for more details.

#' Load built-in data
data("main_long_raw", package="phyloprofile")

#' Process data for distribution analysis
#' See ?phyloprofile::create_variable_distribution_data
data <- create_variable_distribution_data(
    main_long_raw, 0, 1, 0.5, 1
)
head(data, 6)

#' Choose a variable for plotting and set the variable name
var_type <- "var1"
var_name <- "Variable 1"

#' Set cutoff for the percentage of present species in each supertaxon
percent_cutoff <- c(0,1)

#' Set text size
dist_text_size <- 12

#' Create distribution plot
create_var_dist_plot(
    data,
    var_name,
    var_type,
    percent_cutoff,
    dist_text_size
)
```

# Examples
## Process raw input
Process raw input (in different format) into a dataframe that contains all
required information for the phylogenetic profile analysis.

```{r}
#' Load built-in data
#' If input data is in other format (e.g. fasta, OrthoXML, or wide matrix),
#' see ?phyloprofile::create_long_matrix
raw_input <- system.file(
    "extdata", "test.main.long", package = "phyloprofile", mustWork = TRUE
)

#' Set working rank and the reference taxon
rank_name <- "class"
ref_taxon <- "Mammalia"

#' Input a user-defined taxonomy tree to replace NCBI taxonomy tree (optional)
taxa_tree <- NULL

#' Choose how to aggregate the additional variables when pocessing the data
#' into supertaxon
var1_aggregate_by <- "max"
var2_aggregate_by <- "mean"

#' Set cutoffs for for percentage of species present in a supertaxon,
#' allowed number of co orthologs, and cutoffs for the additional variables
percent_cutoff <- c(0.0, 1.0)
coortholog_cutoff_max <- 10
var1_cutoff <- c(0.75, 1.0)
var2_cutoff <- c(0.5, 1.0)

#' Choose the relationship of the additional variables, if they are related to
#' the orthologous proteins or to the species
var1_relation <- "protein"
var2_relation <- "species"

#' Identify categories for input genes (by a mapping tab-delimited file)
group_by_cat <- FALSE
cat_dt <- NULL

#' Process the input file into a phylogenetic profile data that contains
#' taxonomy information and the aggregated values for the 2 additional variables
profile_data <- from_input_to_profile(
    raw_input,
    rank_name,
    ref_taxon,
    taxa_tree,
    var1_aggregate_by,
    var2_aggregate_by,
    percent_cutoff,
    coortholog_cutoff_max,
    var1_cutoff,
    var2_cutoff,
    var1_relation,
    var2_relation,
    group_by_cat,
    cat_dt
)

head(profile_data)
```

## Create profile plot
Generate phylogenetic profile heatmap after processing the raw input file.
```{r, fig.show='hold', dev='CairoPDF'}
#' Load built-in processed data
data("full_processed_profile", package="phyloprofile")

#' Create data for plotting
plot_df <- data_main_plot(full_processed_profile)

#' You can also choose a subset of genes and/or taxa for plotting with:
#' selected_taxa <- c("Mammalia", "Echinoidea", "Gunneridae")
#' selected_seq <- "all"
#' plot_df <- data_customized_plot(
#'     full_processed_profile, selected_taxa, selected_seq
#' )

#' Identify plot's parameters
plot_parameter <- list(
    "x_axis" = "taxa",
    "var1_id" = "FAS",
    "var2_id"  = "Traceability",
    "low_color_var1" =  "#FF8C00",
    "high_color_var1" = "#4682B4",
    "low_color_var2" = "#FFFFFF",
    "high_color_var2" = "#F0E68C",
    "para_color" = "#07D000",
    "x_size" = 8,
    "y_size" = 8,
    "legend_size" = 8,
    "main_legend" = "top",
    "dot_zoom" = 0,
    "x_angle" = 60,
    "guideline" = 0,
    "color_by_group" = FALSE
)

#' Generate profile plot
heatmap_plotting(plot_df, plot_parameter)

#' To highlight a gene and/or taxon of interest
taxon_highlight <- "Mammalia"
rank_name <- "class"
gene_highlight <- "OG_1019"
#' Then use ?phyloprofile::highlight_profile_plot function
# highlight_profile_plot(
#    plot_df, plot_parameter, taxon_highlight, rank_name, gene_highlight
# )
```

## Create protein domain architecture plot
Generate the domain architecture plot for a gene of interest and its orthologs.
```{r, fig.show='hold', dev='CairoPDF'}
#' Load protein domain architecture file
domain_file <- system.file(
    "extdata", "domain_files/OG_1009.domains",
    package = "phyloprofile", mustWork = TRUE
)

#' Identify IDs of gene of interest and its ortholog partner
seedID <- "OG_1009"
orthoID <- "A.thaliana@3702@241736"
info <- c(seedID, orthoID)

#' Get data for 2 selected genes from input file
domain_df <- parse_domain_input(seedID, domain_file, "file")

#' Generate plot
plot <- create_archi_plot(info, domain_df, 9, 9)
grid::grid.draw(plot)
```

## Other use cases
