Description: This package contains a proposed revision to the
        stats::ks.test() function and the associated ks.test.Rd help
        page.  With one minor exception, it does not change the
        existing behavior of ks.test(), and it adds features necessary
        for doing one-sample tests with hypothesized discrete
        distributions.  The package also contains cvm.test(), for doing
        one-sample Cramer-von Mises goodness-of-fit tests.
