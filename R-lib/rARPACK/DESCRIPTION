Description: Previously an R wrapper of the 'ARPACK' library
    <http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/>, and now a shell of the
    R package 'RSpectra', an R interface to the 'Spectra' library
    <http://yixuan.cos.name/spectra/> for solving large scale
    eigenvalue/vector problems. The current version of 'rARPACK'
    simply imports and exports the functions provided by 'RSpectra'.
    New users of 'rARPACK' are advised to switch to the 'RSpectra' package.
