         printing of confidence intervals (thanks for Rich Heiberger and

    o    print for confint method indicates if confidence 
         intervals are adjusted or univariate


Changes in 0.991-7 (2006-12-19)

    o    try to deal with non-estimable coefficients in `model': if the
         correspondings columns of `linfct' are zero anyway, we silently
         proceed. If not, we stop and ask for a correctly specified model.

    o    try to detect interactions with numeric covariates. We need to
         choose a specific value here but it seems hard to add 
         something appropriate to the user interface (I don't want to touch
         `mcp'). For the time being, we fire a warning and the user can 
         modify `linfct' manually.

    o    add mcp(<name> = "Means"), contribution by Richard M. Heiberger
         <rmh_at_temple.edu>

         values directly (with x being either a function or a scalar)


Changes in 0.991-3 (2006-11-30)

    Implement feature requests by Rich Heiberger <rmh_at_temple.edu>:

    o    glht.mcp adds a `focus' element to the returned object
         containing the names of the factors under test

    o    plot.glht calls plot.confint.glht

    o    documentation updates

    o    fixed three minor bugs


Changes in 0.991-2 (2006-10-27)
