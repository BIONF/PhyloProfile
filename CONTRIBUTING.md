Thank you so much for your interest in contributing to *PhyloProfile*! üéâüëçüçæ

Contributions to *PhyloProfile* can take many forms. If you are

**biologist**, you can
* [report bugs](https://github.com/BIONF/PhyloProfile/issues/new) for both online & standalone version,
* [tell us about what features you would love to see](https://github.com/BIONF/PhyloProfile/issues/new),
* improve our documentation, both [in the Wiki](https://github.com/BIONF/PhyloProfile/wiki) and in our [README](https://github.com/BIONF/PhyloProfile/blob/master/README.md),
* discuss about [non-coding issues](https://github.com/BIONF/PhyloProfile/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Anon-coding)

**biologist and love coding**, you can
* [fix existing bugs](https://github.com/BIONF/PhyloProfile/issues/),
* or add new features. Some things we'd love to see are
  * add scripts to add out-of-the-box support for further orthology prediction tools,
  * increasing the test coverage from 0% to something above that,
  * or basically whatever great idea you have!
* and all points for non-coding contributors as well :)

**not biologist but can code**, it would be great if you can
* test the tool in different environments (Windows, Linux, Mac - Firefox, Chrome, IE, Safari,...)
* suggest a better user interface
* improve the code quality
